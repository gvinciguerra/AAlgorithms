\section{External memory implicit searching}
Given a static input array $A$ of $N$ keys in the EMM (external memory or cache-aware model), describe how to organize the keys inside $A$ by suitably permuting them during a preprocessing step, so that any subequent search of a key requires $O(\log_B N)$ block transfers using just $O(1)$ memory words of auxiliary storage (besides those necessary to store $A$). Clearly, the CPU complexity should remain $O(\log N)$. Discuss the I/O complexity of the above preprocessing, assuming that it can uses $O(N/B)$ blocks of auxiliary storage. (Note that the additional $O(N/B)$ blocks are employed only during the preprocessing; after that, they are discarded as the search is implicit and thus just $O(1)$ words can be employed.)

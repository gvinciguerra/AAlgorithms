\section{Wrong greedy for minimum vertex cover}

Find an example of (family of) graphs for which the following greedy approach fails to give a 2-approximation for the minimum vertex cover problem (and prove why this is so). 
Start out with an empty $\tilde{S}$.
Choose each time a vertex $v$ with the largest number of incident edges in the current graph.
Add $v$ to $\tilde{S}$ and remove its incident edges.
Repeat the process on the resulting graph as long as there are edges in it.
Return $\abs{\tilde{S}}$ as the a approximation of the minimal size of a vertex cover for the original input graph.
Generalize your argument to show that the above greedy algorithm cannot actually provide an
$r$-approximation for any given constant $r >1$.

\paragraph{Solution}
We split the $N = 3n$ nodes in two partitions of sizes $n, 2n$ that we call $L, R$ respectively.
We then build the edges in the following way in order to obtain a minimum cover $L$:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $\abs{R} = 0$ we stop.
	\item Split the current slice $R$ in half: let $R^i$ be this slice.
	\item For every node $n \in R^i$ build $i$ outgoing edges to each of the $\abs{L}$ nodes $\in L$.
	Note as for $\abs{R^0} = \frac{2n}{2} = n$ each node reaches exactly one node $\in L$.
	Halving $R^0$ we double the number of outgoing edges to $L$, we maintain the number of outgoing edges from $R$ constant.
	We can then repeat step $1$ with $R \gets R \setminus R^i$.
	\end{enumerate}
Once the above procedure ends, we have $deg(n) = deg(n') $ for any $n, n' \in L$ because at each split every node in $L$ received an incoming edge.
Each node in $L$ will have an incoming edge for every node $n \in L$.
The greedy algorithm then starts by removing the highest-degree node: we find this on top of $R$, as it was doubled at each iteration.
It is therefore forced to reach $R^0 = 1$ where $deg(n) = 1$.
As this was the very first cut, we have to remove $n$ nodes.
The set $\tilde{S}$ has then $\sum_{i = 2}^{n}\frac{n}{i}$ nodes:
	\begin{equation*}
	\sum_{i = 2}^{n}\frac{n}{i} = n \sum_{i = 2}^{n}\frac{1}{i} \approx n \ln n
	\end{equation*}
Since $n \ln n > n = $ minimum cover, we have a generalization for any $n$.

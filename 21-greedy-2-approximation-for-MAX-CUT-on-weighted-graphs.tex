\section{Greedy  2-approximation for  MAX-CUT  on  weighted  graphs}
Prove  that  the  greedy algorithm for \emph{MAX-CUT} described in class gives also a $2$-approximation for weighted graphs with positive weights.

\paragraph{Solution.}
Let $G$ be our undirected weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.
As stated in class, the greedy algorithm scans sequentially the ordered nodes, deciding at each iteration $i$ whether to add the node $v$ to the cut or not by computing the following:
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{add?}{$v$, $S$}
	\State $S' \gets S \cup \{v\}$\;
	\If{$E(S') > E(S)$}
		\State $S \gets S'$\;
	\EndIf
	\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
With a weighted graph we need to slightly modify the above:
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{add?}{$v$, $S$}
	\State $S' \gets S \cup \{v\}$\;
	\If{$\sum_{n \in S'}{w(n)} > \sum_{n \in S}{w(n)}$}
	\State $S \gets S'$\;
	\EndIf
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
The above is computed for each vertex $v$ in local search but only $r_v = \abs{E_v}, E_v = \{v' | \exists e(v + \delta, v) \in E\}$ for the greedy algorithm, that is the nodes with a greater ordering and with a colliding edge on $v$.
By applying the above function we have an $r'_v$.
We also know that in a non-weighted case, given any vertex $u$, at least $\frac{r_u}{2}$ vertexes are in the cut: if this was not true, then we could add one cut, switching $v$ from $S$ to $\bar{S}$ or vice versa increasing the number of nodes in the cut.
A weighted variant is trivial: as the non-weighted case chooses to switch $v$ according to $\sum{r^i}$, we choose to switch according to the weight sum $\mathcal{W} = \sum{\omega(r^i)}$.
It follows that $r'_v = \sum{\omega(\text{edges incident to v in the cut}}) \geq \sum{\frac{\omega \left( \text{incident edges on v} \right)}{2}}$. \\
Therefore we have the weights in the cut
\begin{equation}
E_{\omega} = \sum_{v \in V}{\frac{\omega(r'_v)}{2}} =
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in V}{\omega(r'_v)} =
\frac{1}{2} \mathcal{W(G)}
\end{equation}

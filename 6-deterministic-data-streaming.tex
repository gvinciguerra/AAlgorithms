\section{Deterministic data streaming}

Consider a stream of $n$ items, where items can appear more than once in the stream.
The problem is to find the most frequently appearing item in the stream (where ties
broken arbitrarily if more than one item satisfies the latter).
Suppose that only $k$ items can be stored, one item per memory cell, where the
available storage is $k + O(1)$ memory cells.
Show that the problem cannot be solved deterministically under the following rules:
the algorithm can allocate only $O(poly\log(n))$ bits for each of the $k$ items that
it can store (i.e. $O(\log^{c}(n))$ for any fixed costant $c$ > 0), and can read
the next item of the stream; you, the adversarty, have access to all the stream,
and the content of the $k$ items stored by the algorithm, and can decide what is
the next item that the algorithm reads (please note that you cannot change
past, namely, the items already read by the algorithm).
\\Hint: it is an adversarial argument based on the k items chosen by the
hypothetical determinist streaming algorithm, and the fact that there can be a
tie on $> k$ items till the last minute.

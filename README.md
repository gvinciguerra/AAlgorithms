# Advanced-Algorithms
Formal implementation and case studies for the Advanced Algorithms course.

# Sections guide
You can see in detail the section's structure in the table of contents of the pdf.
More formally:
    - \section{Problem title}
    - Informal description of the problem.
    - Link to the pdf description, footnotes would be best.
    - \subsection{Solution name}
    - Informal description of the solution.

## The algorithm
You are free to describe your algorithm as you want, but in order for it to be easily
understandable take care to be formal and include pseudo-code and use case examples.
A detailed description of the computational classes and memory cost can help greatly.
You can add any credits you deem necessary, and link to your implementation, if you like.


# Collaboration
New solutions can be submitted through pull requests. If you are not familiar with them,
you can find an in-depth description [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

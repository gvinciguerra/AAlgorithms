# Advanced-Algorithms
Formal implementation and case studies for the Advanced Algorithms course.

# Sections guide
You can see in detail the section's structure in the table of contents of the pdf.
More formally:
    - \section{Problem title}
    - Informal description of the problem.
    - Link to the pdf description, footnotes would be best.
    - \subsection{Solution name}
    - Informal description of the solution.

## The algorithm
You are free to describe your algorithm as you want, but in order for it to be easily
understandable take care to be formal and include pseudo-code and use case examples.
A detailed description of the computational classes and memory cost can help greatly.
You can add any credits you deem necessary, and link to your implementation, if you like.

# Style guide
The following style guide shall be followed:

- **Indentation:** 2 spaces.
- **Packages:** Included at the start of the document, add a brief description and try
to indent them as the previous ones.
- **Computational cost:** You should add it in a __hbox__ like this:

    ``\begin{framed}
    \noindent
    \textbf{Computational cost}: $O(m + MAX\_TIME)$.
    \end{framed}``

# Collaboration
New solutions can be submitted through pull requests.
No new branches will be added.
If you are not familiar with them,
you can find an in-depth description [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

## Issues
If you find any problem in the solutions or any other detail, please use the repository's **Issues** section.

## Slack
I'm using [slack](slack.com) to organize, if you want to synchronize our efforts, you should find the team at [unipi-inf-lm.slack.com](https://unipi-inf-lm.slack.com)

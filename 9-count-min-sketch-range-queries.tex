\section{Count-min sketch: range queries}

Show and analyze the application of count-min sketch to range queries $(i, j)$ for
computing $\Sigma_{jk=i}^{k} F[k]$.\\
Hint: reduce the latter query to the estimate of just $t \leq 2 \log(n)$ counters
$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_t$.
Note that the probability at most $\delta$ of error (i.e.\ that $tl = 1 c l > jk = i F[k] + 2 \log(n) \norm{F})$,
it does not suffices to say that it is at most $\delta$ the probability of error
of each counter $c_l$: while each counter is still the actual wanted value plus
the residual as before, it is better to consider the sum $V$ of these $t$ wanted
values and the sum X of these residuals, and apply Markovâ€™s inequality to $V$ and
$X$ rather than on the individual counters.

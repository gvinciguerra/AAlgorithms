\section{Special case of most frequent item in the stream}

Suppose to have a stream of $n$ items, so that one of them occurs $> \frac{n}{2}$
times in the stream.
Also, the main memory is limited to keeping just two items and their counters, plus
the knowledge of the value of $n$ beforehand.
Show how to find deterministically the most frequent item in this scenario.
\\ Hint: since the problem cannot be solved deterministically if the most
frequent item occurs $\leq \frac{n}{2}$ times, the fact that the frequency is
$> \frac{n}{2}$ should be exploited.

\paragraph{Solution.}
We'll use the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $j^i$ is the $i$th most frequent element.
  \item $C$ is the frequencies function: $C(j^i) = \#\text{occurencies of } C^i$. 
\end{itemize}
Before illustrating our solution we prove that the following hold:
    \begin{itemize}
    \label{frequence_dominance}\item Given the $j^{1}$ element, $C(j^{1}) > C(j^{i}) \forall i \in S$.
    \item Following the previous, $C(j^{i}) < C(j^{i}),  i > 1$ element.
    \item There are at most $\frac{n}{2} - 1$ elements in S: given that $j^{1}$ appears at least $\frac{n}{2} + 1$ times, in the best case scenario every other $\frac{n}{2} - 1$ element is different, giving $\frac{n}{2} - 1$ different elements.
    \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recursive sub-streams} It is trivial to show that if we were to have $\frac{n}{2}$ counters,
\begin{equation*}
\sum^{\frac{n}{2}}_{i = 0, i \neq 1}\left( C(j^{i}) < C(j^{1}) \right)
\end{equation*}
by~\ref{frequence_dominance}.
We can also assert that given
\begin{equation*}
  S' = S[0, \frac{n}{2}], S'' = S[\frac{n}{2} + 1, n], k = \text{number of elements} \in S
\end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$j^{1}$} is the sub-stream dominant element in either $S', S''$: by contradiction, let us assume that is false.
    Then $\exists j_{o} \neq j^{1}: C(j_{o})$ in $S' > C(j^{1}$, $\exists j_{o}: C(j_{o})$ in $S'' > C(j^{1})$; given that $S'S'' = S$, that would make $C(j_{o}) = C(j^{1})$: contradiction.
    \item More generally, given two sub-streams $S', S''$, the sub-stream dominant element of $S'S''$ is one of the sub-stream dominants in $S'$ or $S''$ and its frequencies are defined by $$e - k - 1\textrm{ in } S', \frac{n}{2} + 1 - (e - k - 1) \textrm{ in } S''$$ where $e$ is an arbitrary number of appearances of $j^{2}: e < \frac{n}{2} + 1$.
    The reader will see as the $+1$ in the right side guarantees the sub-stream dominant to be maximum.
    The sides can be swapped without hurting generality.
    \end{itemize}

In order to better illustrate, we provide an algorithm (the Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm) that exploits the sub-stream dominance.
Our idea is to \emph{go up} with our counter when we are fed an object we've already met, and to \emph{go down} when we are fed an object different from us.
Once we reach the bottom (0), we know that we either reached zero for an object $\neq j^{1}$, and we can ignore it, or we reached zero for $j^{1}$, that being the most frequent element will have sub-stream dominance in the remaining sequence, which means it will \emph{go upper} than any other element in that sub-stream.
Given that any other element has lower frequency, the most frequent of them, $j^{2}$ will \emph{go down} $e < \frac{n}{2} + 1$ times.

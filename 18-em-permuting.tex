\section{External memory (EM) permuting}
Given two input arrays $A$ and $\pi^{-1}$, where $A$ contains $N$ elements and $\pi^{-1}$ contains a permutation of $\{1, \dots, N\}$, describe and analyse an optimal external-memory algorithm for producing an output array $C$ of $N$ elements such that $C[i] = A[\pi[i]]$ for $1 \leq i \leq N$.

\paragraph{Solution.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We define an array $\pi^{-1}$ such that $\pi^{-1}[i] = (\pi, i)$ of the form (departure, destination): note as we need $O(\frac{N}{B})$ block transfers.
	\item We then sort $\pi^{-1}$ according to the departure with the previously defined $k$-way mergesort in $O(\frac{N}{B} log_{\frac{M}{B}} \frac{N}{B})$ block transfers. $\pi^{-1}$ now holds the ordered departures with respective index where to send the elements to (the destination).
	\item We can now build $A\pi^{-1}$ with entries $(\pi^{-1}[i].destination, A[i])$ of the form (destination, element).
	As we ordered by the departures we scan $A$ sequentially: $A\pi^{-1} = [(destination, A[0]),$ \\$(destination, A[1]), (destination, A[2]), \dots]$: again we have $O(\frac{N}{B})$ block transfers.
	\item We run one more ordering over such tuples in $A\pi^{-1}$, this time according to the destination: we now have an ordered mapping \emph{destination}($\pi[i]$) $\to$ \emph{element} and we are able to write it to memory with $O(\frac{N}{B})$ block transfers:
	\begin{gather*}
	  sort(A\pi^{1}) = [(0, A[x]), (1, A[x]), (2, A[y]), (3, A[x]), \dots ] = \\
	  = [(0, A[\pi[0]]), (1, A[\pi[1]]), (2, A[\pi[2]]), (3, A[\pi[3]]), \dots ] 
	\end{gather*}
\end{enumerate}
The I/O complexity of the solution is dominated by the cost of sorting, that is $O(\frac{N}{B} log_{\frac{M}{B}} \frac{N}{B})$.

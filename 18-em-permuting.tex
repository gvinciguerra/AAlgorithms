\section{External memory (EM) permuting}
Given two input arrays $A$ and $\pi^{-1}$, where $A$ contains $N$ elements and $\pi^{-1}$ contains a permutation of $\{1, \dots, N\}$, describe and analyse an optimal external-memory algorithm for producing an output array $C$ of $N$ elements such that $C[i] = A[\pi[i]]$ for $1 \leq i \leq N$.

\vspace{0.5cm} \paragraph{Solution.}
We define an array $\pi^{-1}$ s.t. $\pi^{-1}[i] = j : \pi[j] = i$, that is the inverse mapping of $\pi$: \emph{position} $\to$ \emph{index}.
We define an array $A\pi^{-1}$ s.t. $A\pi^{-1}[i] = (A[i], \pi^{-1}[i])$ of the form (element, shuffled index): note as we need to load $2 \cdot \frac{N}{B}$ blocks.
We then sort $A\pi^{-1}$ with the previously defined k-way mergesort in $O(n \cdot \log(n))$ time and $O(\frac{N}{B})$ loads.
By filtering $A\pi^{-1}$ over the first pair's element we have the ordered $C$ we wanted to obtain, and we are able to write it to memory with $O(\frac{N}{B})$ memory transfers.
We then have a total of
\begin{equation*}
m = 2 \cdot \frac{N}{B} + O(\frac{N}{B}) + O(\frac{N}{B}) \in O(\frac{N}{B})
\end{equation*}
$m$ memory transfers with complexity of $O(N \cdot \log_k(N))$.
